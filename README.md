# NaNoGenMo2015

This is my first attempt at NaNoGenMo, an idea by [@tinysubversions](https://twitter.com/tinysubversions/status/396305662000775168). Details at [their github](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015).

My attempt involves creating a set of virtual people who will fight to the death (or, currently, repeatedly die of thirst) in a virtual arena. They all write a diary which is serialised.

The latest output is [here](novel/output.md).
