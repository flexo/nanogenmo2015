I'm now back at the burnt meadow with the bush; It's been 219 hours since I was last here, I'm getting thirsty; I had to get to None! 

There was water west; I moved west to the meadow. I'm now back at the meadow with the bush and the derelict shack. It's been 270 hours since I was last here. I needed to get to None; there was water south. 

I moved south to the beach, I'm now back at the beautiful, expansive beach, It's been 272 hours since I was last here, I had to get to None, I wanted to escape! I felt sleepy. I fell asleep; I drink! I woke up, I'm now back at the beautiful, expansive beach, It's been 281 hours since I was last here! 

I moved east to the forest; I returned to the thick, deciduous forest, it was the first time I had been here for 1318 hours; I am resting.
