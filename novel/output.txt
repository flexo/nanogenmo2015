It's been 22 hours since I was last here, I move north to the meadow, I'm back at the meadow; It's been 7 hours since I was last here, I move west, I've come across a river; I move east to the meadow. I'm back at the meadow. It's been 9 hours since I was last here. I move south to the river. I'm back at the river. It's been 26 hours since I was last here, I move east to the forest, this is now my 5th day in the game; I'm back at the forest. It's been 28 hours since I was last here. I move west to the river! I'm back at the river. It's been 28 hours since I was last here; I'm getting thirsty. There is water here, I drink! I'm back at the river. It's been 29 hours since I was last here! I move south! 

I've come across a meadow. I move south, I've come across a forest, I move north to the meadow, I'm back at the meadow; It's been 2 hours since I was last here, I move east; I've come across a forest; I move west to the meadow! I'm back at the meadow. It's been 4 hours since I was last here, I move east to the forest; I'm back at the forest. It's been 2 hours since I was last here; I'm getting thirsty. I have to get to water, I know the location of water. It is west; I move west to the meadow; I'm back at the meadow. 

It's been 6 hours since I was last here. I want to get to water; there is water north, I move north to the river; I'm back at the river, It's been 37 hours since I was last here! 

I'm thirsty, there is water here. I drink, I'm back at the river, It's been 38 hours since I was last here! I move west! I've come across a river; I move north; I've come across a river, I move west! I've come across a river, I move west; I've come across a forest; and here I am!
