Hi Frederick

I came across a forest an hour ago; there was a stream here; Olivia, Sophia, Amelia, Florence, and Archie were there; I attacked Florence, I punched Florence with my left fist in the chest; Florence swiped me in the stomach with their right fist! 

I punched Florence with my left fist in the arm. Florence punched me in the chest with their left fist. I kicked Florence with my left foot in the chest; Florence tackled me in the chest with their left foot. I punched Florence with my right fist in the arm, Florence punched me in the stomach with their left fist. 

I pummelled Florence with my left fist in the face; Florence tackled me in the shin with their right foot! I kicked Florence with my left foot in the leg, Florence punched me in the neck with their right fist, I swiped Florence with my left foot in the groin; Florence ran away, I'm now back at the forest with the stream.

Yours, Tyler

Mum,

I returned to the meadow with the bush and the derelict shack, fifteen hours ago, I moved west! I came across a burnt, rolling meadow fourteen hours ago, there was a statue of a polar bear here, I was getting thirsty; I needed to get to water. 

I was feeling sleepy. I fell asleep; there was a stream east, I moved east to the meadow; I woke up; I returned to the meadow with the bush and the derelict shack, five hours ago. 

It was the first time I had been here for eleven hours; I was getting thirsty. I needed to get to water. There was a stream north! I moved north to the forest! I returned to the forest with the pair of fallen telegraph poles. 

Four hours ago, it was the first time I had been here for thirteen hours. I was thirsty; I needed to get to water! 

There was a stream east. I moved east to the forest. 

I returned to the forest; three hours ago. It was the first time I had been here for one hundred and fourth-nine hours; I was thirsty. I wanted to get to water, I felt afraid. I needed to escape; there was a stream north. 

I moved north to the forest! I returned to the forest with the stream, two hours ago! It was the first time I had been here for one hundred and fifty-one hours; I was thirsty! I wanted to get to water; I drink. I returned to the forest with the stream; an hour ago. It was the first time I had been here for one hundred and fifty-two hours, I moved south to the forest; this is now my 12nd day in the game; I'm now back at the forest. 

It's been one hundred and fifty-two hours since I was last here!

Yours, Florence

I returned to the forest with the stream! Four hours ago! 

It was the first time I had been here for fifty-seven hours, I was feeling afraid; I needed to escape, I moved west to the forest, I had been in the game for 26 full days. I returned to the forest with the stream, three hours ago. It was the first time I had been here for fifty-nine hours, I moved east to the forest, I returned to the forest with the stream. Two hours ago, it was the first time I had been here for fifty-nine hours; I wanted to escape, I moved north to the beach, I returned to the beach, an hour ago. It was the first time I had been here for thirty-one hours. I moved north! 

I'm now in a meadow, there is a bush here; there is a brook here! There is a derelict shack here, I must get to a place to sleep; there is a bush here! 

That's this diary up to date.
