There was a bush here! 

There was a stream here, I moved north; I came across a meadow eighteen hours ago; I moved east; seventeen hours ago I came across a beautiful beach, I needed to get to a place to sleep! There was a bush west. I moved west to the meadow. I returned to the meadow. Sixteen hours ago. It was the first time I had been here for two hours. 

I was feeling sleepy, I fell asleep, there was a bush south, I moved south to the meadow, I had been in the game for 17 full days; I woke up, I'm now back at the meadow with the bush and the stream. 

It's been nineteen hours since I was last here; there is a bush here!

Hello Mum and Dad

I moved west to the meadow, I returned to the lush, desolate, wetland meadow with the bush and the derelict shack. Four hours ago! It was the first time I had been here for ten hours; I had to get to water; I knew the location of a stream; it was west, I moved west to the meadow, I returned to the meadow with the bush and the pair of fallen telegraph poles; three hours ago; it was the first time I had been here for twelve hours; I had to get to water! There was a stream north! I moved north to the meadow! I returned to the meadow; two hours ago. 

It was the first time I had been here for four hundred and seventy-two hours! I had to get to water; there was a stream north, I moved north to the meadow; I returned to the beautiful, grassy, hilly meadow with the stream. An hour ago; it was the first time I had been here for four hundred and seventy-four hours! I'm really thirsty. I had to get to water.

Hello Diary:

I returned to the beautiful, grassy, barren meadow with the bush the brook and the giant lightning-struck tree, fifteen hours ago. It was the first time I had been here for four hours. 

I moved north. I came across a beautiful beach fourteen hours ago, I moved west; thirteen hours ago I came across a meadow. I moved west, I came across a beautiful, grassy, hilly meadow twelve hours ago; there was a stream here, I moved west! 

Eleven hours ago I came across a hilly meadow, there was a pair of fallen telegraph poles here, I'm getting thirsty! 

I wanted to get to water, I was feeling sleepy, I fell asleep. There was a stream east. I moved east to the meadow, I woke up; I returned to the beautiful, grassy, hilly meadow with the stream; an hour ago. 

It was the first time I had been here for eleven hours, I'm getting thirsty, I needed to get to water! I drink, I'm now back at the beautiful, grassy, hilly meadow with the stream, it's been twelve hours since I was last here!

I returned to the lush, desolate, wetland meadow with the bush and the derelict shack, four hours ago, it was the first time I had been here for one hundred and seventy-four hours, I'm getting thirsty, I had to get to water, there was a brook east! I moved east to the meadow. I returned to the meadow with the bush and the derelict shack; three hours ago. It was the first time I had been here for one hundred and seventy-seven hours. 

I needed to get to water, there was a brook north. I moved north to the meadow! I returned to the beautiful, grassy, barren meadow with the bush the brook and the giant lightning-struck tree! 

Two hours ago. It was the first time I had been here for two hundred and fourth hours. I'm thirsty! 

I needed to get to water! 

I needed to escape! I drink; I returned to the beautiful, grassy, barren meadow with the bush the brook and the giant lightning-struck tree; an hour ago, it was the first time I had been here for two hundred and fourth-one hours; I moved south to the meadow! I'm now back at the meadow with the bush and the derelict shack; it's been one hundred and eighty hours since I was last here!

I moved east to the meadow, I returned to the beautiful, grassy, hilly meadow with the stream. An hour ago! It was the first time I had been here for one hundred and thirteen hours; I'm thirsty, I had to get to water; I drink. I'm now back at the beautiful, grassy, hilly meadow with the stream, it's been one hundred and fourteen hours since I was last here!

Yours, Freya

Hello Diary:

I returned to the meadow, six hours ago, it was the first time I had been here for one hundred and thirty-two hours; I moved south to the meadow, I returned to the meadow with the bush and the stream; five hours ago. It was the first time I had been here for one hundred and ten hours. I moved south to the meadow, I returned to the lush, desolate, wetland meadow with the bush and the derelict shack! Four hours ago, it was the first time I had been here for ninety-five hours. I'm getting thirsty; I needed to get to water. There was a stream north. I moved north to the meadow! 

I returned to the meadow with the bush and the stream. Three hours ago! It was the first time I had been here for one hundred and twelve hours. I'm thirsty! I had to get to water, I drink! I returned to the meadow with the bush and the stream. 

Two hours ago. It was the first time I had been here for one hundred and thirteen hours, I moved east to the meadow; I returned to the beautiful, grassy, barren meadow with the bush the brook and the giant lightning-struck tree; an hour ago. 

It was the first time I had been here for one hundred and twelve hours. I moved west to the meadow. I'm now back at the meadow with the bush and the stream; it's been one hundred and fifteen hours since I was last here; I must get to a place to sleep. There is a bush here, that's this diary up to date.

Yours, Freya
