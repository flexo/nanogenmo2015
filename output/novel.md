I'm now back at the pretty, silty beach; It's been 15 hours since I was last here; I moved north to the meadow. I'm now back at the muddy meadow with the bush! It's been 34 hours since I was last here; I moved east; I came across a barren meadow, there was a bush here, there was a pair of fallen telegraph poles here; Oliver was there, I felt afraid; I wanted to escape. I moved south; I came across a beautiful meadow; there was a bush here. 

Oliver was there, I was feeling afraid! I had to escape, I moved north to the meadow; I'm now back at the barren meadow with the bush and the pair of fallen telegraph poles, It's been 2 hours since I was last here! I moved west to the meadow, I returned to the muddy meadow with the bush; it was the first time I had been here for 38 hours, I am resting!
